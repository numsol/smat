This is the SMAT software package.

SMAT is a simple C program with a configuration file-driven interface 
supporting matrix multiplication and QR decomposition implemented in 
Scalapack for the purposes of "burning in" an arbitrary number of 
cluster nodes while testing performance.

Future improvements will include more LAPACK routines and 
implementations supporting heterogeneous architectures such as 
GPGPUs (MAGMA, clMAGMA) and Intel MICs (MAGMA MIC).
